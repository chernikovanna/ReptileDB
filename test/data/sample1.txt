Diagnosis. Crotalus triseriatus armstrongi can be 
distinguished by its pale gray, reddish brown, 
brownish yellow, or yellowish green ground color 
from C. t. triseriatus which has a dark gray or dark 
grayish brown dorsum. In C. t. armstrongi the 
body blotches tend to be as wide orwider than 
long while in C. t. triseriatus the blotches are 
usualIy Ionger than wide. Crotalus t. armstrongi 
further differs from C. t. tnseriatus in that males 
(N=3) generally have fewer ventrals and 
subcaudals, 130-138 (134.3) and 24-26 (25.3), 
respectively, as compared to 136-151 (144.0) and 
26-34 (29.2), respectively. Crotalus t. armstrongl 
can be.distinguished from C. t. aguilus by having a 
distinct postocular stripe, a proportionally smaller 
rattle, and in males possessing fewer ventrals (the 
number usually exceeding 145 in C. t. aqutlus). 
Crotalus t. armstrongl females (N= 6) generally 
have fewer ventrals, 1~8-146~142.0), and more 
subcaudals, 22-25 (23.5) than female C. t. aqullus 
which have 143-160 (151 .7) ventrals and 17-23 
(20.4) subcaudals. The only other rattlesnake with 
which C. t. armstrongi may be confused is C. 
pusillus, but it may be easily distinguished from 
this form by its having fewer ventrals and 
subcaudals,fewer pterygoid teeth, and canthals 
that fall to make contact with each other 
(Campbell 1979: 366).
